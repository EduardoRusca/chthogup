 #BASIC DECISIONS
 chihatan_politics: "Chi-Ha-Tan Politics"
 chihatan_politics_desc: "Chi-Ha-Tan is now on a course to either reform or retain itself. Internal frictions have been circulating long round with rumours here and there. But there are some things that we have taken in to account. We must watch these developments carefully and monitor them with much vigilance. \n\nPolitics is never static for it is always dynamic. And so with that, we must adapt and move accordingly in the ever forward movment of time for the future of the academy."
 february_26: "February 26th Plot"
 february_26_desc: "A plot has now been circulating of a plan of Haru Tamada to overthrow Fukuda's stand in the academy.

Choose Wisely."

 final_ultimatum: "Final Ultimatum to Pravda"
 final_ultimatum_desc: "Pravda has now nowhere else to run. We can keep chasing them but we can keep up. It'd be best if they concede defeat than suffer more. How unwise would it be for them to be blinded by ideals, no?"

 chihatan_opearations_desc: "With the outcome of the last tournament and the events between it, Chi-Ha-Tan has rapidly and suddenly faced many questionings of its own identity in the world of senshadou.

But the rise of two major factions have presented to us a challenge in brains and brawn the operations and missions we as an academy will undertake."

It faces no imminent challenge yet but we are lacking one thing on it: effective and efficient usage. \n\nYes, it has brought itself to grow bigger and bigger but under the observations of many including the industrial giants and geniuses, it is lacking the ability to unlock its true potential and cliber.

Natsuko Hosomi and Tomoyo Ikeda are fighting against what role the zaibatsus should play in the academy. \n\nHosomi advocates for them to be under national guidance and cooperation. \n\nIkeda on the otherhand wants to challenge them with a national one as well."
 IKEDA_VICTORY: "§RDoing nothing will let Ikeda challenge the Zaibatsus for herself if Fukuda is in charge. If Tamada is in place it'd be safe.§!"
