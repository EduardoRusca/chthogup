 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Chi-Ha-Tan Academy stands at a crossroads ever since the 62nd National High School Sensha-dou Tournament. Furui-kyougi, the Olden Doctrine, is favored by Haru Tamada and calls for an invasion into Siberia. Koushin-kyougi, the Renewal Doctrine, is supported by Fukuda and has Southeast Asia and the Pacific as its target. \n\nAnd then, of course, there is always China. Chi-Ha-Tan possesses a formidable spirit, but its industries are starving for resources and time is running out. Which path to choose?"
 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC: "War is raging in the Southeast. Even though Chi-Ha-Tan suffered some losses early in '39, a big portion of Chinese territory is under Chi-Ha-Tan control. Tension is rising in Europe, and while Pravda is focusing their attention on those matters, they shouldn't interfere in the war in Asia, though Saunders is increasingly becoming a worry because of its looming trade intervention. \n\nWe can still change things before the tournament starts but that comes with its own issues. But when China's resources are in Chi-Ha-tan’s hands, Pravda will be easy to deal with. Nishi Arare!"
